## Introduction 


### Question
Can we identify the common factors in schools with high lead contamination in water?
The government can work with the schools to provide resources to reduce and prevent lead contamination in water to increase the health of the students.

### Data science opportunity
Exposure to lead contamination can affect children’s’ growth, behavior and learning problems. 
We can use data to identify the common factors in school with lead contamination and use this to better address and prevent the problem. 

### Impact hypothesis
By identifying the factors of lead contaminations in water and school that are high risk, the government can work with the schools to improve the water system and implement frequent testing to ensure that the water is safe. 

## Data Description
1.	WA School Water Lead Test Data (school year 2018-2019)

Source 2: https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/data-portal

One row of data represents the school’s name, school district, county, city, date and time of lead sample collection, and lead concentration. Additional data sets provide demographics of student body at the school and median household income at the county level. 

**Features**
Lead concentration, date and time of analysis (day of the week and time of collection), demographics and income.

## Tools
